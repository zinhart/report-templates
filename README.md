# report-templates
Templates for documenting ctf's or network based pentests

## Usage

With your working folders created you can create an obsidian vault at the root of this project  
and get to hacking!

A couple of things worth mentioning:
- For a writeup to appear in the index you must move it into the finished folder.
- You cheat yourself when you look at a writeup before using all of the enumeration you know at a point in time, whether you use this template, your own, or someone else's.
